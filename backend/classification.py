1. First, check if it's an outgoing_payment:
   - check the payment_details.net_amount if it is less than 2000 than it is outgoing payments
   - Look for payment-related keywords like 'payment', 'voucher', 'receipt'
   - If both conditions are met, classify as 'outgoing_payment'

2. If not an outgoing_payment, check if it's an ap_invoice_with_lc:
   - Look for LC (Letter of Credit) references in:
     * payment mode
     * particulars/description
     * vendor details
     * lc_no
   - if invoice_details.lc_no is preset it is ap_invoice_with_lc  
   - If LC is found, classify as 'ap_invoice_with_lc'

3. If neither of the above, classify as 'ap_invoice':
   - This is the default for standard vendor invoices
   - No special conditions needed

Important:
- Follow the order: outgoing_payment â†’ ap_invoice_with_lc â†’ ap_invoice
- Return ONLY one of these labels: outgoing_payment, ap_invoice_with_lc, or ap_invoice
- Do not include any explanations or additional text
